**"What did you do before Cryptex?"**

I was working at a company called Opolis. I was the lead engineer there. Opolis is trying to make healthcare or benefits available at cheaper rates for freelancers. I also did a bit of payroll automation or stuff like that. Yeah. So I was a lead engineer there.

**"What is your role at Cryptex?"**

I'd say I'm mainly a solidity developer, but I like to help out with the dashboard that interacts with the smart contract through the UI. So a mixture of frontend as well.

**"When did you first get into crypto?"**

It was late 2017. I was working at a FinTech company. I had a job and while we were there, crypto was pretty hot. It was the ICO days. At the FinTech company, we were at, we were doing analysis of different financial products. Someone decided we should investigate crypto, that's when I got into it. Then, I started contributing to Ethereum, just so that I got to know how it really works. You could say I started in early 2018, where I got hands-on with Ethereum.

**“What do you like about Ethereum as someone who’s contributed to the chain?”**

It's the community, a very accepting community. There’s a lot of smart people I like to hang out with and I get to learn a lot from them basically. That's what I love about the community.

**"What's a fun fact that people don't know about you?"**

I'm a guitar player. I've been playing for the past 15 years. I do not have any formal training in music. I started playing in the church, um, but I try to practice every day. I’m by no means a professional, but yeah, I'm a guitar player.

**"What's the best Cryptex meme you've seen?"**
