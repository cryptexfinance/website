Liquidity incentives have averaged triple digit rewards for system providers since the launch of TCAP on April 8th, 2021 and CTX on April 21, 2021.

Between October 7th, 2021 (ETH/TCAP) and October 17th, 2021 (ETH/CTX) a total of 700,000 CTX will unlock from initial liquidity pool incentives established upon launch and are available for continued staking.

Today, we announce Single Side CTX Staking and the extensions of the ETH/TCAP and ETH/CTX LP’s to the world.

* SINGLE SIDE STAKING NOW LIVE WITH 60,000 CTX ADDED TO THE POOL FOR STAKING, ZERO LOCKUP, REWARDS 100% PER BLOCK BASIS FOR 6 MONTHS, 7 DAY MINIMUM STAKING PERIOD. BEGINS THURSDAY OCTOBER 7TH.
* ETH/TCAP LP EXTENDED WITH 100,000 CTX ADDED TO THE POOL, REWARDS 100% PER BLOCK BASIS FOR 6 MONTHS, ZERO LOCKUP. BEGINS MONDAY OCTOBER 11TH.
* ETH/CTX LP EXTENDED WITH 100,000 CTX ADDED TO THE POOL, REWARDS 100% PER BLOCK BASIS FOR 6 MONTHS, ZERO LOCKUP. BEGINS SUNDAY OCTOBER 24TH.

### Key Numbers Regarding CTX Supply:

Circulating supply will be 2,523,906 as of October 24th. The new rewards for Single Side Staking, ETH/TCAP and ETH/CTX total an additional 260,000 CTX over the next 6 months.

The Cryptex Team has 740,000 CTX earmarked for future rewards, liquidity incentives for new Cryptex tokens and strategic partnerships.

The Cryptex DAO has a treasury balance of 4.926 million CTX that will remain locked in our community treasury, only accessible via the passing of a community vote for continued DAO initiatives and incentives.

Proposals for these initiatives and incentives include such things as:

1. Strategic investments to grow the DAO, its contributors (blockchain development, product research and analysis, community, brand, legal, day to day operations, etc.)
2. Treasury diversification
3. Further liquidity pool incentives for TCAP, as well as future Cryptex tokens that will be announced soon.

In keeping with our DAO's mission of TCAP and CTX reaching the hands of the world in a fully decentralized manner, the core team will not be operating as Crypt Keepers (protocol delegates) and rewards this task to members of our community.

You can find the full list of Crypt Keepers here: [](https://app.cryptex.finance/governance)<https://app.cryptex.finance/governance>

Instructions on how to stake and delegate to Crypt Keepers will be published tomorrow 10/7/21.

1. In order to propose a vote, a minimum of 100,000 CTX is required.
2. In order to pass a vote, a minimum of 400,000 CTX is required.

With a minimum of 400,000 CTX staked to the new Single Side Staking System and the extension of ETH/TCAP and ETH/CTX liquidity pools, our community has the power to continue earning CTX rewards, the same time they can delegate voting to members of our community to pass the proposals needed for the DAO to continue to thrive.

We look forward to continuing this journey together.
