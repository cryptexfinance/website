Cryptex (CTX) the protocol and community behind Total Crypto Market Cap token (TCAP), is constantly inspired and impressed with the creators and builders of web3. Cryptex created Space Invaders to help people get an inside look into the minds of the most important web3 creators and builders of our time. \*\*\*\*

On October 14th, 2021, Cryptex welcomed Preston van Loon and BFresh as host, and [The Daily Gwei](https://thedailygwei.substack.com/)'s Anthony Sassano ([@sassal0x](https://twitter.com/sassal0x)) as the guest of the 7th episode of Space Invaders. Typically these episodes are recorded live on Twitter Spaces then published on YouTube and a variety of podcast platforms.

In this post, we are sharing the most thought-provoking and alpha-infused pieces of the conversation. These are things most people would not get a chance to find out unless they were listening to the conversation at air time, which you can find on our Youtube channel and podcast form.

Read on for the alpha leaks from Space Invaders Episode 7 with Anthony Sassano from The Daily Gwei.

**BFresh**: Would you consider yourself an ETH maxi? It doesn't have to be a toxic type of maxi - I know that 'toxic' and 'maxi' are kind of mixed up sometimes, but what do you think about that?

**Sassano**: The funny thing is that the term has become so loaded and has lost most of its meaning that I think most people just use it as a derogatory term to discount others' views and opinions on things. Based on the original meaning of that word as someone who just thinks everything other than ETH is a scam, I wouldn't consider myself that.

From the perspective that I want to work on ETH because of the cohesive community and wide range of people, like Preston, who believe that ETH is great for the world, I'm an ETH maxi. Technical stuff and forks are secondary - the mode of Ethereum is its community and social later.

**BFresh**: NFTs have been going nuts the past couple of months. On your YouTube show you mentioned something about not understanding them, then a bit later were repping a Penguin - What do you think about NFTs?

**Sassano**: I like collecting things like game consoles, which is something I understand. That being said, I think NFTs in general are going to be the biggest on-boarding vehicle crypto will ever have. DeFi will be bigger in terms of value over the long-term, but NFTs appeal to a much larger group of people. I mean, I am bullish on DeFi because it's just a better infrastructure than what we currently have, but NFTs help get more people involved in crypto by letting them collect something, which people like to do. Getting people to do stuff on-chain is an uphill battle - and I think NFTs are really helping with that.

**Preston**: I'm not much of an NFT guy, but I really like the proof of participation stuff. The thing that excites me about Ethereum is bridging the virtual world into the real world. So what could NFTs represent in the real world? Some sort of physical property ownership or like a receipt of an experience?

**BFresh**: I was going to bring this up, actually. In what form do you think NFTs will be the most valuable?

**Sassano**: Value is so subjective because you could have monetary value or even social or utility value of something. And as for gaming, that's a whole other thing since I tend to separate gaming from NFTs. I think a lot of games are going to slap on NFTs and play to earn, and maybe get some traction. They'll ultimately fail because they didn't make a good game. That said, I'm very bullish on the crypto gaming sector.

**BFresh**: How have you guys seen crypto culture change over the past few years? This could include going back to the Bitcoin days when it was only Bitcoin, all the way up to now.

**Sassano**: It's changed pretty dramatically. It's funny how it was just originally Bitcoin, and it's still there, but it's definitely opened up a lot more. It had to open up because you can't just unbolt the world if you just stick to that one niche like Bitcoin people did with being anti-state, anti-government, and the like. But a more pragmatic approach to dealing with the centralized incumbents would be to subsume them rather than tear them down entirely, which is sort of where the culture has shifted to as Ethereum has gained popularity.

**BFresh**: A big topic of discussion was having multi-client support for Ethereum to increase decentralization.

**Sassano**: We really don't want one client to be the majority two-thirds of the network for security reasons. One concern was that the Prism client was so good at onboarding and educating, so it took a big market share. So we really shouldn't shame people, force them, or blackmail them to use different clients for the diversity of the network - migration to a diverse set of clients should be natural.

**Preston**: We need to talk to people to understand why so many are in Prism and why they are not on others, and what we can do to help with transitioning. It's not that Prism is so much better, because every client essentially does the same thing, it's just understanding user behavior better.

**BFresh**: In this case, out-competing other clients is a bad thing, then.

**Sassano**: Yeah, it's kind of like that whole 'stronger together' thing, right?

**BFresh**: Do you guys think the future of Ethereum will be multi-chain? Is there any scenario where Ethereum won't be a settlement layer for L2 sidechains?

**Sassano**: I think that Ethereum will remain the settlement layer for the foreseeable future. Ethereum really is the only kind of chain that has a chance of becoming the global settlement layer, I think.

**Preston**: I agree. I think that most users are going to be in L2, while Ethereum remains the settlement layer and kind of like the cold storage - but most activity will be on layer 2's.

**BFresh**: If Vitalik were out of the picture, would we see more or less adoption and development?

**Sassano**: He's already mostly out of the picture, He's doing a lot of research and has done so much for the project already. We have a lot of smart people working on problems here - if for some reason Vitalik got hit by a bus, I don't think the market should react because it would be such an inconsequential thing for the project at this point.

**Preston**: If he were to say he wants to take a sabbatical for two years, you know we would be fine. I think the market would scream about it, but from a technical perspective, he's done a really great job of reducing his bus factor.

**BFresh**: Did you just say bus factor? 

**Preston**: Yeah - that's like if he got hit by a bus, what would happen? That's the bus factor.
