Weekly, Cryptex will interview one of the core team members involved in building the world's first Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP). This week, Blockchain Developer Cris - a Coffee Lover, Prev. Devcon Scholar at Ethereum Foundation, and Leader of the Honduras Ethereum Community - shares his background and his role in development at Cryptex. Read on to learn about how Cris got into crypto, Cris's favorite community meme, and more.

**"What did you do before Cryptex?"**

* I think my most recent job before I started working with Cryptex was building my own startup called "Affogato." We were doing coffee-related things on Ethereum. I was creating smart contracts for coffee producers and stuff like that. I'm a huge coffee lover, so that's the reason I was working on that. I also live in a country that produces a lot of good quality coffee. Through this, I was also able to meet Preston. At the time I was sustaining myself by working on a lot of community hackathons. I always carried a lot of our coffee products on me. We were selling this coffee and giving it for free at some conferences. I met Preston because he was one of the people I gave free coffee to.

**"When did you first get into crypto?"**

* My first contact with crypto was with Bitcoin in 2013, I was working with mobile payments and was exploring Bitcoin as a payment method. I went to a couple of meetups that talked about different crypto technologies like Stellar. In 2014, I think I heard of a couple of friends talking about Ethereum, but I didn't really understand what they were doing. I started really researching smart contracts in 2017. At the time I wanted to create a medical records project using blockchain technology. I was doing Bitcoin-colored coins and stuff like that, which was really hard. Some months later I had a friend that wanted to create a meetup dealing with smart contracts. I think that's the point of my career, where I got into that rabbit hole. I stopped doing everything I had been. With tools like crypto, they're your own. I was working with other protocols, doing entrepreneurial activities like workshops and training people on how to be entrepreneurs in the region, things like that. After that, I started going full-on developer mode.

**"What is your role at Cryptex?"**

* I am in charge of doing all the development of smart contracts. Sometimes I do some front-end and stuff like that, but the role is to design the smart contracts and implement other popular tools that work. For example, we implemented Synthetix's system for liquidity farming or other custom designs. Mainly I'm in charge of building all the code for the smart contracts.

"**How is coding in crypto different than traditional coding?"**

* You make a real impact. You are also being judged by your skills and based on where you studied. In the traditional startup world, it really depends if you have high connections. There's no master's degree in blockchain development. Nothing like that. If you are good with development or Solidity people will reach out to you. It's more like a meritocracy. So that's something that I really love. Also that your products have a global impact, where anyone can use them. So even if it's harder to code in crypto, or there's more of a challenge learning about secure blockchain tech, it's much worth the sacrifice. It has a greater impact on the world and people.

**"What's a fun fact that people don't know about you?"**

* I love coffee. I also enjoy video games. I read manga, what else? I love playing Dungeons and Dragons, but I don't have people to play with so I'm stuck reading Dungeons and Dragons books, you know, without playing.

**"What's the best Cryptex meme you've seen?"**
