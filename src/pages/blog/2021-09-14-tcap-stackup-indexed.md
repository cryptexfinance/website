Does the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies make your head spin? Or perhaps keeping track of the taxable events while rebalancing your portfolio and having to shell out for gas fees has you down? Enter crypto index tokens: offering broad crypto exposure, savings on gas fees, and automatic rebalancing all to make your investing journey easier. However, as always in crypto, there's more than one option to choose from; let's dig into the various options offered by [Indexed](https://indexed.finance/) and [Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)](https://cryptex.finance/) to see how they stack up.

* Are you new to crypto or unsure which tokens to buy, but believe in the long-term growth of the crypto asset class and want broad exposure to it? - TCAP might be for you.
* Do you already have an established crypto portfolio and are just looking for diversified exposure to a specific crypto market segment? - One of Indexed's 6 index products could be a good option to consider.
* Or perhaps you've called the top of the bull market and you want to open up a short position? - Both Indexed and TCAP's minting capabilities offer this to advanced users.

Certainly there are other considerations to keep in mind for your particular situation as well. But when you're evaluating index token options, whether they be an Indexed product, TCAP, or something else, make sure you keep these key considerations in the back of your mind. Don't forget to stay tuned into Cryptex for more crypto index StackUps.

Indexed currently has six indices available for purchase which each offer holders exposure to various crypto assets. The indices, as described by the Indexed team, are:

* [DEFI5](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/defi-top-5-index) - a hyper-focused index of the most successful large-cap decentralized finance protocols across the Ethereum chain
* [CC10](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cryptocurrency-top-10-index) - an index combining several popular medium/large-cap protocols, primarily drawn from decentralized finance
* [ORCL5](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oracle-top-5-index) - an index representing the current market leaders in protocols designed to bring external data onto the blockchain
* [DEGEN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/degen-index) - a higher risk/reward index of promising Ethereum protocols that have significant room to grow
* [NFTP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nft-platform-index) - a collectors index of governance and protocol tokens drawn from both the NFT space and the wider Metaverse
* [FFF](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/future-of-finance-fund) - a meta-index providing all-in-one exposure to Bitcoin and Ether (20% each), with the remainder weighted across DEFI5, CC10 and DEGEN using circulating market cap weightings.

These indices rebalance in near real-time and vary in number of tokens (6-11), holdings, weightings of holdings, and Total Value Locked ($.32m - $12.56m), with the DEFI5 and DEGEN indices being the most popular by TVL. DEFI5 in particular holds 6 tokens with UNI, AAVE and COMP accounting for over 70% of the current index holdings. For more information, visit [](https://indexed.finance/)<https://indexed.finance/>.

**Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization (TCAP)**

Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP), by the Cryptex team, is designed to give investors accurate, real-time price exposure to the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market via a single, synthetic asset. Data from a number of oracles is aggregated in order to establish a total market cap median value, which is then bridged on-chain through an audited Chainlink Smart Contract.

TCAP rebalances in real-time and by design includes everything: DeFi, DeFi Indexes, Stablecoins, Governance Tokens, Asset-back tokens, and wrapped tokens. For more information, visit [](https://cryptex.finance/)<https://cryptex.finance/>.
