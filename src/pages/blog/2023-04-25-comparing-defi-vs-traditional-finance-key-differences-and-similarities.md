## What is DeFi?

DeFi is a new type of financial system that operates on a decentralized network, such as the Ethereum blockchain. It allows people to engage in financial activities without intermediaries, such as banks or brokerages. DeFi protocols are open-source, meaning that anyone can use them, and they operate 24/7.



# Key Differences between DeFi and Traditional Finance

## Decentralization

DeFi operates on a decentralized network, whereas traditional finance relies on centralized intermediaries, such as banks or brokerages. Decentralization means that DeFi protocols are not controlled by any central authority, and transactions are verified by a network of users.

In traditional finance, intermediaries play a critical role in processing transactions, managing financial products, and providing services. These intermediaries, such as banks, brokerages, and insurance companies, are heavily regulated and often hold a significant amount of power in the financial system.



## Accessibility

DeFi protocols are open-source, meaning that anyone can use them, regardless of their location or financial status. Traditional finance, on the other hand, often requires people to meet certain requirements, such as having a minimum amount of money in their account or living in a specific country.



DeFi allows people who do not have access to traditional financial services to engage in financial activities. For example, people in developing countries who do not have access to a bank account can use DeFi protocols to borrow and lend funds. Additionally, DeFi allows people to access financial services outside of the traditional banking system, such as decentralized exchanges.



## Transparency

DeFi protocols are transparent, meaning that anyone can see the code that they are built on and how they operate. Traditional finance, on the other hand, often operates in a closed system, where information is not readily available to the public.



The transparency of DeFi protocols allows people to see exactly how transactions are processed and how financial products operate. This transparency can help build trust in the DeFi ecosystem. In traditional finance, however, the lack of transparency can make it difficult for people to understand how financial products operate and make informed decisions.



# Similarities between DeFi and Traditional Finance:

## Both provide financial services

Both DeFi and traditional finance provide financial services such as lending, trading, and insurance. However, the way in which these services are provided is different.

## Both are subject to risk

Both DeFi and traditional finance are subject to risk, such as market volatility, fraud, and security breaches. However, the risks associated with each system are different, and users should be aware of these risks when engaging in financial activities.

## Both require trust

Both DeFi and traditional finance require trust from their users. In traditional finance, trust is often placed in intermediaries, such as banks and insurance companies. In DeFi, trust is placed in the code that protocols are built on and the community of users who verify transactions.



# Conclusion

In conclusion, DeFi and traditional finance operate in fundamentally different ways. DeFi is decentralized, open-source, and accessible to anyone, while traditional finance relies on centralized intermediaries. However, both systems provide financial services and are subject to risk and require trust from their users. The emergence of DeFi provides a new way of doing finance that is disrupting the traditional financial system and could potentially change the way we think about finance.
