  responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals.
  This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on
  each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. This edition

Upon the launch of Single Side CTX Staking, Cryptex rolled out the Crypt Keeper delegator program. In an effort to further decentralize the protocol, users must select a delegator when staking. Crypt Keepers are responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals. This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. This edition of our series features our Keeper Huntsman. We asked Huntsman a series of questions on their background, experience, and vision for Cryptex.

**What is your background?**

* Studied economics in college, but continued working service industry jobs after graduation because they paid better than entry-level jobs crunching unemployment numbers. Bartending, cooking, fine dining wait service. I know what it is to scrap together tips to pay a mortgage. Working in film and television the past decade in equipment rentals and as a set electrician. Unsuccessfully ran for public office a couple of times.

**What's your experience working with DAOs?**

* Not much prior to Cryptex, other than owning 1 MKR. One thing that makes me very thankful for discovering Cryptex Finance is that in my quest to earn more CTX I went from just having accounts with a few centralized exchanges to collateralizing and minting TCAP with my own wallet.

**What about Cryptex excites you the most?**

* Well, there is so much because this team and project are so innovative, but in the end for me, it is that I am an early adopter. A few of my friends tried to talk cryptocurrency to me over the years, and I just didn't pay any mind to it, and that has cost me dearly... but even never having owned crypto before February of this year, I feel like I'm right on time with Cryptex, and by investing myself fully into this project I can have true life-changing riches in a decade.

**What is the future you see for Cryptex?**

* TCAP is the perfect, one-stop shop for everyone who wants a piece of the best performing asset class without the intimidation that comes from inexperience in the market. The future I see is pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments around the world buying TCAP. For pensioners retirement will be something to look forward to, even take early... I see TCAP being the premium perpetual futures trading pair with every other major tradable coin, the best soft peg to long or short any coins dominance in the market. I see a CTX treasury that is a "market maker" due to the large basket of crypto assets that collateralize its vaults, paying CTX dividends on overcollateralized vaults. TCAP is just the start of the variety of financial products Cryptex can offer.

**In your view, what are the most important developments that should be prioritized?**

* The most important development to be prioritized in my opinion is the expansion of staking rewards for other TCAP trading pair liquidity pools, especially TCAP-WBTC. Expanded listing to additional exchanges is important, as well as creating an income stream for the CTX treasury as Cryptex expands its suite of financial products offered and collateral held.

**Why should people choose you as their crypt keeper?**

* Personally, I have invested or set aside 3 ETH for my Cryptex play. If I had just bought CTX when I decided I wanted to put 10k into the project... I would have 1600+ votes myself. Instead, I have about 35 CTX, but a collateralized vault and liquidity staked and earning CTX rewards daily. I do not intend to ever sell my CTX until it hits at least a 10B market cap if that. I do not intend to sell any CTX for at least 5 years if that. I'm not super tech-savvy or experienced in the sector, but I have immense faith in the project and team and I do believe this DAO can make us all life-changing, generational wealth while its innovative products like TCAP become a cornerstone of the crypto space. Should I be your crypt keeper? Hard to say, sometimes I doubt myself... getting deep in the community I often feel sophomoric and ignorant... but I will say I'm humbled for your gift of time and that regardless of who you choose to delegate to that I will do my best to always vote in the long term interest of this project.

**What is a hobby of yours?**

* My hobbies include strategy games, gardening, making public comments at city council meetings, and getting out and into nature as often as possible.
