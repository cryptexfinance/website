Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 5th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-15-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-4-nov-14th-2021/)[.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-07-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-3-nov-7-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## 2-Day Chart:

![TCAP 2-Day Chart 11-21-2021](/img/11-21-2-day-chart.jpg "TCAP 2-Day Chart 11-21-2021")

**Analysis:** This week I've chosen to start with the 2 Day chart rather than the 1 Day. The 50 2D SMA (blue line) seems to be a visually clear level of support. Exactly as we anticipated in last week's analysis, this week we saw a dip to the support levels of $2.4T - $2.6T before recovering back and hitting **Resistance 1** around the $2.7T level.

Looking at the chart from a long-term view from left to right, after the crash in May 2021, price consolidation, and the eventual market recovery back from ~$1.4T total capitalization (TCAP) to $2.5T TCAP - Over $1.1 trillion worth of recovery. We saw **Dip #1** in this uptrend from $2.5T back down to around $1.8T at the lowest - around $700M worth. After bottoming out, we saw the next leg up in this uptrend to a new ATH of exactly $3T TCAP. We had predicted a topping off at the $3T price level as it represented a significant round number for the market. Looking at the size of the past dip, we predicted a new dip worth around $500M-700M TCAP and saw clear support at $2.4T.

Looking forward after passing **Resistance 1**, I expect the price to recover to hit **Resistance 2** between the $2.9T - $3T level, if we see the price cross this resistance to reach a new ATH, I expect the TCAP to gain another $400 - $600M in value considering it had recovered from the last dip and pumped an extra $500M over the previous ATH. Early expectations for me is TCAP topping off at $3.5T.

However, if the price does not cross **Resistance 1**, we will look for a break under the blue line to show a clear reverse in the overall trend of the market. The price could consolidate further at these levels before showing a clear sign of where it's headed.

### 2-Day Indicators

![TCAP 2-Day Indicators 11-21-2021](/img/11-21-2-day-indicators.jpg "TCAP 2-Day Indicators 11-21-2021")

* MACD: Seems to be bottoming and looking to curl back up to put in a bullish cross.
* RSI: Indicates the price recovery but is pointing downwards due to hitting resistance. I expect it to rise back from here.
* OBV: Curled up briefly before hitting resistance similar to the RSI.

## Weekly Chart:

![TCAP Weekly Chart 11-21-2021](/img/11-21-weekly-chart.jpg "TCAP Weekly Chart 11-21-2021")

**Analysis:** The weekly chart doesn't tell us much more than the 2-day chart already did, but we will use it to expand the timeframe of our expectations. Based on the 2-day chart we are not expecting the price to drop below $2.4T TCAP which can also be seen here as clear support as it use to be tough resistance previously (resistance becomes support rule.) I do not expect the price to drop to touch the 20 Week SMA (yellow line) but I do expect it to consolidate further until the yellow line catches up to become closer or possibly meet the price. Looking back historically, the weekly dips rarely lasted for one week without consolidating for an extra week or two, so I'm expecting to see another consolidation week between the $2.8T and $2.4T levels before the price recovers to put in a new ATH and continue to the 3rd leg up of this bull market.

### Weekly Indicators:

![TCAP Weekly Indicators 11-21-2021](/img/11-21-weekly-indicators.jpg "TCAP Weekly Indicators 11-21-2021")

* MACD: Pointing downwards, too far from a bearish cross, indicating more consolidation coming.
* RSI: Pointing sharply downwards after hitting the border of undersold levels.
* OBV: Pointing slightly downwards after a new ATH indicating more consolidation as well.

## Monthly Chart:

![TCAP Monthly Chart 11-21-2021](/img/11-21-monthly-chart.jpg "TCAP Monthly Chart 11-21-2021")

**Analysis:** As we are expecting more consolidation this upcoming week from the previous two charts, and looking at the monthly chart as it is now, I expect our current monthly candle (C) to resemble candle A by the time it closes.

As I am bullish on the extended timeframe of the market I expect next month's candle (D) to resemble candle B as a long green candle with a topping tail at $3.5T TCAP. After that, we could see the next crash as it will represent the 2nd large up-leg of the uptrend on the monthly chart, but that is just early speculation.

### Monthly Indicators:

![TCAP Monthly Indicators 11-21-2021](/img/11-21-monthly-indicators.jpg "TCAP Monthly Indicators 11-21-2021")

* MACD: Still pointing upwards, not as strongly as before indicating the current consolidation month is affecting it.
* RSI: Passed previous resistance but still has room to go up before we can say it's topped off. Sideways direction indicates current consolidation.
* OBV: Pointing downward in a channel. Will break out of this channel when the next big move comes.
