**"What did you do before Cryptex?"**

I was working at a local company in Honduras. The main product was EP software. I was a full-stack developer there and I used to develop APIs and design databases. Last year I was developing some mobile apps and also I started work with Cris on Affogato. That was my full-time job, I was working on other projects too.

**"What is your role at Cryptex?"**

I'm a full-stack developer. I'm in charge of the front end mainly. I'm also developing the subgraph for our UX, where we can query the data from our smart contracts easily. Any new technology that we use in the front end, I implement.

**"When did you first get into crypto?"**

I think I heard about Bitcoin first, but wasn't interested. When I heard about Ethereum in 2017, I thought that it was just another crypto coin. That's when I started working with Cris on the medical records project that he had. Then I realized that there was something else and Ethereum had many possibilities and opportunities to develop exciting apps and other things. So I would say 2017.

**How is the Crypto community in Honduras?**

It's becoming popular in Honduras right now. There's a lot of people getting involved here, but right now it's a small community. It's growing very well and rapidly because this idea is not known. This kind of thing is new for everybody. It's kind of hard to let people know that this is an opportunity to invest because they are afraid of these things, but I think it's growing very well. We have to try to introduce them to it as the right option because most people only know about Bitcoin. We are letting the people know about Ethereum too.

**"What's a fun fact that people don't know about you?"**

I love sports, I'm a huge soccer fan.

**"What's the best Cryptex meme you've seen?"**
