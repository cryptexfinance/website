A well ajusted DAO treasury is fundamental to expand the development of the DAO's project be it software integration or marketing on the web.

In the search for a diversified, reliable and bulletproof DAO treasury several alternatives are often taken:

**Growth oriented side**

1. Native Token : In most cases DAOs will allocate an important part of their treasury to their crypto project's Native Token. While it is good to hold an important part of the DAO's native token to show confidence in its value and use cases, it also poses a great problem for the stability of the treasury. Depending on the scale of development of the project and its token or on the security viability of the token, volatility will result. This leads to the treasury's value being based solely on the market value of the DAO's native token and having great swings in treasury fund that can compromise future development or even the entire project.
2. Proved Ecosystem Cryptos (ETH/BTC) : DAOs will necessarly have confidence in the blockchain on which they have developped their crypto project and may want to invest in the crypto asset associated with the wider blockchain (ETH being the mainet asset for Ethereum). Along with ETH (or the specific mainet blockchain crypto) DAOs might allocate a smaller part of the treasury to BTC because of its status as "digital gold" and its ability to stir the market.

**Stability oriented side**

1. Stablecoin : In the search for a reliable short/middle term treasury DAOs may allocate a minor part of their assets to Stablecoins like USDT, BUSD or USDC. This type of allocation favors a balanced approch to treasury funding and is proven in times of wild market volatility.
2. Liquidity Pool Pair : For stable and consistent returns on investments some DAOs will chose to provide liquidity for their Native Token pairs on Decentralised Exchanges. Depending on the chosen pair it can lead to high returns bringing unparalled and liquid revenue streams for the treasury.

Here's a graph on the typical allocation for a DAO's treasury.

As you can see, the common allocation of funds goes like :

* 60% - 85% to Native Token
* 5% - 15% to Ecosystem Cryptos
* 5% - 15% to Stablecoins
* 5% - 10% to Liquidity Pool Pair

Most treasuries will have a mix of growth-oriented and stability-oriented investments with an amphasis on growth due to an over exposure to Native Tokens.

DAO's will hold their native token between 60% and 90% of the treasury's fund, some will even allocate 100% of the treasury to their token.

This concentration of allocation will lead to higher risk factors for the DAO treasury by replicating the market value of their token thus affecting negatively the fund during troubled times.

Consider a risk factor between 1 and 3 (1 being a non volatile asset like a stablecoin and 3 being a very volatile asset) with this scale we can categorize and evaluate the reliability and security of the DAO treasury for future growth.

A Native Token will have a risk factor of 3 because of its inherent volatility as a low/middle tier market cap token and the early developments of the project.

Ecosystem cryptos can be assessed with a risk factor of 2 because of their long term viability and the trust of the crypto community but they are equally risky during market cycles.

Stablecoins by their nature replicate the US Dollar and so have no risk whatsoever. The different stablecoins offered by crypto companies can stumble on legal issues but the risk is negligible putting stablecoins at a risk factor of 1.

Liquidity Pool Pair are usually thought as more risky than solely investing but it actually is a pretty safe way to hold long term on two assets while accumulating "dividends". If one of the asset depreciate the other appreciate to offset the loss in liquidity.

**TCAP : the answer for growth and stability.**

Some aggregated data on TCAP's performance :

YTD performance : +138%

QTD performance (July 1st) : +31%

With a current Crypto Market Capitalisation of $2 Trillion, TCAP gives DAOs the opportunity to capture the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem without compromising on decentralisation, security and governance flexibility.

TCAP gives the opportunity for DAOs to allocate a part of their treasury to the S&P 500 of cryptocurrency. The crypto sector is known for its volatile cycles and otherwise unimaginable returns on obscure altcoins.

With TCAP's ability to replicate the total capitalisation of the cryptocurrency market DAOs can capture exponential future growth while offsetting the inherent risk of investing in single cryptocurrencies or token. TCAP positions itself with a risk factor of 2 comparable to Ecosystem Cryptos like BTC or ETH but with bigger historical performance
