Does the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies make your head spin? Or perhaps keeping track of the taxable events while rebalancing your portfolio and having to shell out for gas fees has you down? Enter crypto index tokens: offering broad crypto exposure, savings on gas fees, and automatic rebalancing all to make your investing journey easier. However, as always in crypto, there's more than one option to choose from; let's dig into the [Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW)](https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/funds/Bitwise-10) and [Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)](https://cryptex.finance/) to see how they stack up.

* Are you new to crypto or unsure which tokens to buy, but believe in the long-term growth of the crypto asset class and want broad exposure to it? - TCAP might be for you.
* Do you want exposure to ~80% of the crypto assets in your brokerage or IRA account? - BITW could be a good option to consider.
* Or perhaps you've called the top of the bull market and you want to open up a short position? - Both BITW and TCAP support this; BITW through opening a short position in a brokerage account, and TCAP through its minting and secondary market capabilities.

There are certainly other factors to consider, but when you evaluate index token options, whether they be BITW, TCAP, or something else, make sure you keep these key considerations in the back of your mind. Don't forget to stay tuned into Cryptex for more crypto index StackUps.

BITW rebalances monthly with the latest allocation holding 10 tokens: BTC, ETH, and ADA account for over 90% of the current index holdings with other assets including BCH, LINK & LTC.
