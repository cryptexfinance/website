Cryptocurrencies have been around since [2009, and took off in 2017 when Bitcoin reached $10,000 USD and Ethereum’s arrival was marked by ICOs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/12/06/a-short-history-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-currency-everyone-should-read/?sh=594dbdde3f27). The total value of the crypto market is constantly changing, and it's hard to keep track of its worth.

In this article, we will take a look at the current value of the crypto market and try to answer some questions about it. 

*Disclaimer: Data from figures posted in thie article are from 10/22/2022.* 

**How Much Is The Total Crypto Market Worth?**

The total crypto market is worth $959,493,664,993. For comparison, gold's market cap is $11.4 trillion. Although the value of cryptocurrencies is much smaller than that of other assets, it has been growing at a rapid pace.

**How Much of The Crypto Market Is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin's market cap is $368,569,529,944, which is about one-third of the entire crypto market. This shouldn't be too surprising, as Bitcoin is the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrency.

**How Much Is 100 bitcoins Worth?**

100 Bitcoins is worth $576,261. For just over half a million dollars, you could own 100 out of the 21 million Bitcoins to ever exist. This amount of BTC ownership would make you a "Bitcoin Fish" (50-100 BTC) or a "Bitcoin Dolphin" (100-500 BTC).

**Who Owns The Most Bitcoin?**

The pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (Satoshi) is thought to own the most Bitcoin. However, this cannot be confirmed, as Satoshi's identity remains a mystery.



[Satoshi Nakamoto's wallet](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa) holds approx. 5% of all Bitcoins currently and it's estimated to be about 1 million in total.



Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Brian Armstrong, and Michael Saylor are all candidates for public figures with the most Bitcoin.



These are all self-made billionaires who have believed heavily in cryptocurrencies.



Changpeng Zhao is the founder and CEO of [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.



As an early adopter of Bitcoin, CZ has amassed a large amount of BTC. He is one of the richest people in the world, and his net worth is estimated to be around $33 billion.



Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are twin brothers who are best known for co-founding Facebook. They are now venture capitalists and business executives.



The Winklevoss twins are also Bitcoin billionaires, and their net worth is estimated to be $2.2 billion each.



Brian Armstrong is the CEO and co-founder of [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. He is a self-made billionaire, and his net worth is estimated to be $2.7 billion. 



Michael Saylor is the CEO of MicroStrategy, a publicly traded business intelligence company. He is also a major investor in Bitcoin and has been buying up BTC for his company.



As of September 20, 2022, MicroStrategy owns 130,000 Bitcoins (worth approx. $2,496,819,000).



Networth does not indicate a larger BTC holding. The time of market entry and total portfolio allocation also affect how much BTC someone has. However, it can give us an idea of how much they could potentially own.

**What Percentage of All Money Is Bitcoin?**

As of Nov. 26, 2021, a Bitcoin was valued at $54,572. The total value of all the bitcoins in the world equaled $1.03 trillion. [This accounted for approx. 2.9% of the world's money.](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-much-worlds-money-bitcoin/#:~:text=A%20bitcoin%20was%20worth%20%2454%2C572,2.9%25%20of%20the%20world's%20money.)



However, as the price of BTC has dropped to $19,197.60, the total percentage of the world's money has decreased.



It can be debated that all money is already Bitcoin. At least for money that is truly worth holding.



Let's take a look at the US dollar, for example. The US dollar is no longer backed by gold, but it is still accepted as a global reserve currency. The US dollar's value is based on faith and trust. People believe that the US dollar has value because the US government says it does.



The US government can print as much money as it wants, and this will cause inflation. This means that each dollar is worth less and less over time.



The value of Bitcoin, on the other hand, is based on mathematics and sound mechanics. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. This hard limit on the supply of BTC means that its value can't be diluted by inflation. As demand for Bitcoin increases, its price will increase



So, when asking the question, "What percentage of all money is Bitcoin?" It depends on how you define money. If you consider all the fiat currencies in the world, then Bitcoin is a very small percentage.



However, if you view Bitcoin as the only form of viable sound money, then it comprises 100% of all money.

**How Do We Calculate The Cryptocurrency Market Cap?**

By combining the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, we get the total value of the cryptocurrency market. 



The total market cap of a single cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price of each cryptocurrency by its circulating supply. So, if there are 100 units of a cryptocurrency with a price of $1 each, the market cap would be $100. The Cryptocurrency Market Cap can be referenced on various different websites such as [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), [Live Coin Watch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/) as well as on the [Cryptex Finance DAPP. ](https://app.cryptex.finance/)



**Final Thoughts**

Tracking the entire crypto market cap can be a great way to get an overview of the health of the market. It can also help identify trends and predict price movements.



It's also important to remember the total market cap of cryptocurrencies is ever-changing, and it can be tedious to keep up with the latest numbers.



At the time of writing, the total crypto market is worth $959,493,664,993. By the time you read this, the number would have changed.



That's why Cryptex Finance created TCAP (Total Crypto Market Cap) Index Token. The first token to track the total market cap in real-time, providing holders with exposure to the cryptocurrency market cap. 



TCAP is similar to the S&P500 where individuals are exposed to a whole industry. If the total crypto market cap is 1 trillion, TCAP is $100. It accurately tracks the market cap price using  [Chainlink’s](https://chain.link/) price oracles which enables Cryptex to aggregate multiple data points from the top crypto data providers in the world, bringing that data on chain using Ethereum smart contracts. 



TCAP is available to be minted on the [Cryptex](https://app.cryptex.finance/) [F﻿inance App](https://app.cryptex.finance/) or swappable on[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) and [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/swap). TCAP is also available on [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/custody#) for custody.
