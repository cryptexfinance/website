Upon the launch of Single Side CTX Staking, Cryptex rolled out the Crypt Keeper delegator program. In an effort to further decentralize the protocol, users must select a delegator when staking. Crypt Keepers are responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals. This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. The first edition of this series features our Keeper dnkta.eth. We asked dnkta a series of questions on their background, experience, and vision for [Cryptex](https://cryptex.finance/#home).

**What is your background?**

My background is in computer science. I have been working in IT for 10 years and recently decided to go full-time with crypto. I bought my first Bitcoin in 2013 but only started following the crypto space closely since the beginning of 2017. Since then crypto and blockchain technologies have become my biggest passion!

**What's your experience working with DAOs?**

I'm a DeFi power user and have been voting on proposals with my tokens in different DeFi projects. I have been contributing to the CryptexDAO since April 2021 in any way I can. DAOs are very exciting for me and my dream is to work full time for DAOs!

**What about Cryptex excites you the most?**

The fact that there was no presale, no ICO, or any VC funding. This was a big reason I got involved with Cryptex since the beginning. Cryptex being a full community-driven project excites me the most. We have many great people contributing to the DAO with research, writing, design, and development. Everyone can get involved and this is amazing and truly revolutionary! From a technical perspective - TCAP being the first total crypto market cap token ever.

**What is the future you see for Cryptex?**

I would like to see TCAP being adopted in the same way the stablecoin DAI was adopted, and I believe this will be achieved in the next few years. I'm excited to see TCAP being used as collateral in other DeFi protocols and also being used for diversifying DAO treasuries.

**In your view, what are the most important developments that should be prioritized?**

Finding more developers to work on Cryptex, perhaps allocating CTX rewards for a development contest. We need Vault monitoring, automation, and liquidation protection.

**Why should people choose you as their crypt keeper?**

I think there should not be a single crypt keeper with most of the votes, we should concentrate on diversifying voting power. Delegate to me or someone else but do delegate!

**What is a hobby of yours?**

Besides crypto - listening and playing electronic music. Walking with my dog and enjoying time in nature.
