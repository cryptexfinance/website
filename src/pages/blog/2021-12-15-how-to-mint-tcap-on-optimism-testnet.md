Cryptex provides users access to the markets of tomorrow. In an effort to get Cryptex on a network with minimal fees while not sacrificing security, governance, and decentralization we've decided to first launch on Optimism. To make this integration as secure and smooth as possible, we are asking users to try out minting TCAP on Optimism Testnet and share their feedback about their experience.

Minting TCAP on the Optimism testnet is easy, just follow these simple steps!

## Have a MetaMask wallet created and ready to use on desktop (the preferred experience)

If you don't already have a MetaMask wallet, you can download it here: [](https://metamask.io/)<https://metamask.io/>. Other decentralized wallets will work as well but for this tutorial, we will be using MetaMask.

## Install the Optimistic Ethereum Kovan network onto your MetaMask Wallet

To use Optimism's Kovan chain, you will need to add it to your Metamask wallet.

1. Head to [](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/)<https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/>
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Select "Add OP Kovan Network."
4. Select "Approve" on the popup to add the network to your Metamask. Then confirm to "switch network."

## Request test ETH

1. Visit [](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)<https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/>
2. Sign in with Twitter
3. Enter your wallet address & Click Claim
4. Within a few seconds, you should see the ETH. Make sure your MetaMask wallet is set to the Optimistic Ethereum (Kovan) network.

## Mint TCAP

Before we explain how to mint TCAP using ETH as collateral we want to briefly explain why someone would want to do this in the first place.

* You have ETH that you want to be stored in a secure place
* You want to utilize a portion of it to generate yield
* Instead of borrowing a stablecoin or individual coin/token, you can borrow the entire crypto market with TCAP
* Ideas for using the TCAP you borrowed in DeFi: [](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-29-borrowing-assets-using-eth-as-collateral/)<https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-29-borrowing-assets-using-eth-as-collateral/>



### Here are the steps to mint TCAP:

1. Create ETH Vault

* Visit [](https://develop.cryptex.finance/vault/ETH)<https://develop.cryptex.finance/vault/ETH>
* Make sure your network is set to the Optimistic Ethereum (Kovan) NOT mainnet or another network
* Click Create Vault then approve the MetaMask transaction
* Click Approve Vault then approve the MetaMask transaction

3. What to do after you minted TCAP?

You've minted TCAP and have it in your wallet, that concludes the testnet experience!

If this were on mainnet, some people might ask, what can I do with my TCAP after I mint it? Here are a few strategies our community has shared: ["Borrowing Assets using ETH as Collateral."](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-29-borrowing-assets-using-eth-as-collateral/)
