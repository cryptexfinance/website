Today, 4/21, Single Side Staking (SSS) rewards have been extended.

12,655 CTX have been added to the SSS pool for the next 3 months.

This extension comes from the core contributor multi-sig earmarked since genesis for such rewards and not from the Cryptex DAO treasury, which remains locked and only accessible via the passing of on-chain votes by the community and its protocol delegates.

Voting CTX in this pool is at 967,939 CTX governance delegations.\

Any core contributor CTX delegated to this pool are for voting only and are NOT staked to earn additional CTX rewards alongside members of the DAO community.

The Cryptex DAO plans for single sided staking to be with us for the duration of the protocol and thanks its Crypt Keepers (protocol delegates) for their feedback in this recent rewards extension.
