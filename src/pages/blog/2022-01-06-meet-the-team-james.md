**Weekly, Cryptex Finance will interview one of the core team members involved in building the world's first Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP). This week, Voith shares his background and his role in development at Cryptex.**

**"What did you do before Cryptex?"**

I mean, I've done so many things. Mainly what I have tried to focus my life around is just being involved in teams, creative teams, creative projects whether it's by myself or with professional work. I also just really like working. I like being productive. I've tried to just kind of craft my life right around creating stuff, creating stuff with people. I like sometimes being a small cog in a much bigger machine and being on a team is what interests me. That's what propels me to do anything. That's my favorite part about Cryptex is that how well we operate as a team with literally no connection before this. It's interesting, it's an effective team. I appreciate it.

**"What is your role at Cryptex?"**

I really serve as one of the creative conduits to help get the ideas, as far as advertising or as far as public exposure to line up with the brand identity. I'm one of a team of people that are required to do that. I really feel like I'm one of the instigators, like Joe or Tom will come up with an idea and it'll click with me in a way and we'll start rolling with it. Or, they'll say they kind of want this and we'll build a spreadsheet and talk with Cullen about the ways to take their idea from the nebulous concept into a tangible video or a tangible release that conveys the message of Cryptex while also engaging people in a fun way.

**"When did you first get into crypto?"**

It was 2017 and I had a buddy in Nashville who was like, “you gotta look at Bitcoin, you gotta look at Ethereum.” He was just constantly talking about it. When I finally moved up to New York, I was like, all right, he's been talking to me about it for like three or four years. This was like right around the time where Coinbase was becoming a stable and accepted app. I downloaded that and I just started acquiring mostly Ethereum just because as I started to learn more about it, it was the more interesting blockchain technology. Once Preston found out about it and really started going with it, then I was like, oh yeah, this is right.

**“What’s it like making content for crypto versus regular companies?”**

It's similar in different ways. As far as Cryptex, the branded material that we put out there, we're not a dentist's office. You know what I mean? So in that respect, it's very different than working with most other types of clients. Most other types of clients represent an industry. They have very strict guidelines as to what boxes they need to check and what boxes they need to stay within.

We have a little more flexibility as far as what we can put in the videos or what we can do creatively. I think that is the biggest difference. The biggest similarity is that, we still make spreadsheets. We still make a shot list for everything. We still go over the same process that we would, it's just way more fun because we're allowed to do right. Things creatively that most companies would not even do.

**"What's a fun fact that people don't know about you?"**

I don’t know, there's just so many strange things. I craft, I literally have to keep my hands busy. I cannot stay still. I have to keep busy yesterday. I made like 30 candles last night. I bought an e-bike a couple of years ago and I was deep in that rabbit hole. I was working on it every day. I took the thing apart twice, I took every screw out of that bike. Took everything apart multiple times. I just need to keep my hands busy.

**"What's the best Cryptex meme you've seen?"**
