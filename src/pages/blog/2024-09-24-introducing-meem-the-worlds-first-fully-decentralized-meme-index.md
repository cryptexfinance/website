Cryptex is beyond thrilled to deploy a brand new Index market for the DeFi ecosystem.

MEEM is a collective of MEMEs in a single, fully decentralized index solution.

MEEM is fully upgradable and more components can be added over time.

Criteria: 

* Classified as Memecoin (except ETH)
* Ranked top 100 by market cap
* Sufficient liquidity on Ethereum

The index is managed by the Cryptex DAO via on chain protocol governance.

MEEM is now live as a fully decentralized perpetual market on Arbitrum.

With a 1:1 MEEM Index deploying on Base soon™️

MEEM Components:

DOGE, SHIBA, PEPE, FLOKI, ETH

Weighting:

20%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%

*Index formula:  MEEM Index Price = 0.2  (Current DOGE Price / DOGE Mark Price) + 0.2  (Current SHIB Price / SHIB Mark Price) + 0.2  (Current PEPE Price / PEPE Mark Price) + 0.2  (Current FLOKI Price / FLOKI Mark Price) + 0.2 * (Current ETH Price / ETH Mark Price)* 

MEEM is powered by:

* Chainlink: Low latency price feeds
* Perennial: Infrastructure
* Gauntlet: Parameter calculations
