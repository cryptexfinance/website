# What is DeFi?

DeFi refers to a set of financial applications built on blockchain technology that allow for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or brokers. DeFi platforms rely on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. DeFi platforms include lending and borrowing protocols, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and more.

## Examples of DeFi platforms include:

### Compound

[Compound](https://compound.finance/) is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings by lending them to borrowers. The platform uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate borrowing and lending without the need for intermediaries.

### Uniswap

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens directly from their wallets. The platform uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to facilitate trades, which relies on liquidity providers to add funds to the pool.

### MakerDAO

[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a decentralized platform that allows users to borrow a stablecoin called DAI, which is pegged to the value of the US dollar. The platform uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure that the value of DAI remains stable.

# What are Derivatives?

Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset, such as stocks, commodities, or currencies. They can be used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. Common types of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, and swaps.

## Examples of derivative markets include:

### Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)

CME is a derivatives exchange that offers futures contracts on a wide range of assets, including commodities, currencies, and stock indices.

### Options Trading Platforms

Options trading platforms allow users to buy and sell options contracts on a variety of assets. These contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date.

# What are Perpetual Markets?

Perpetual markets are a type of derivatives market that allows traders to speculate on the price movements of an underlying asset without ever having to take ownership of the asset. Perpetual markets are based on perpetual futures contracts, which are similar to traditional futures contracts, but have no expiration date.

## Examples of perpetual markets include:

### GMX

[GMX](https://gmx.io/#/) is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers perpetual futures trading for a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The exchange has a user-friendly interface, and traders can use leverage of up to 100x on their trades. 

### Binance Futures

[Binance Futures](https://www.binance.com/en/futures) is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that offers perpetual futures contracts on a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### Cryptex Finance

[Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/) is a decentralized derivatives market platform on Arbitrum that allows users to trade crypto-native markets, such as the Total Crypto Marketcap, with up to 20x leverage..

These markets are based on blockchain technology and rely on smart contracts to create decentralized systems that enable peer-to-peer transactions. By removing intermediaries and creating more transparent and efficient markets, DeFi, derivatives, and perpetual markets have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about finance. They offer new opportunities for investors to diversify their portfolios, hedge against risk, and earn passive income through lending and staking.
