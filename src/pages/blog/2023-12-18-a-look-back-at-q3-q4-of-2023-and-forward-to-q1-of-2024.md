As 2023 draws to a close, contributors want to take a moment to reflect on the progress the DAO has made and set the stage for the exciting plans ahead. The community's unwavering support has been the cornerstone of DAO growth, and we're thrilled to share our journey with you.

#### Q3 2023: A Quarter of Innovative Development

Q3 was marked by significant advancements in platform capabilities:

The DAO launched 4 new perpetual markets, enhancing the V2 ecosystem with individual and index-based markets for TCAP, ARB, ETH, and PERPE. This expansion has offered users a broader and more dynamic experience.

A Pro Interface was developed, empowering sophisticated users to deploy liquidity seamlessly without the constraints of vaults, providing greater control and flexibility over their trading strategies.

Also initiated was an Affiliate Program, with intentions of rewarding active users and contributors to the growth of our markets, strengthening our community engagement.

In efforts to increase transparency and user empowerment, functionality to display winning trades instantly and to show detailed trade histories with enhanced metrics was implemented, fostering a more informed and user-friendly environment.

#### Q4 2023: Reaching new heights

Building on the momentum, Q4 saw the DAO reach new milestones:

The deployment of 8 new perpetual markets on the Arbitrum network widened reach, bringing innovative trading solutions to more users.

Controbutors diligently worked on reducing oracle latency with Chainlink and Pyth, which has greatly improved the speed and reliability of market data, crucial for trading decisions.

The introduction of PI has revolutionized the platform by increasing capital efficiency, speed, and liquidity depth, reinforcing commitment to innovation.

Expanded DEX accessibility on the Arbitrum network, further integrating our platform into the wider ecosystem.

A retroactive airdrop provided tangible rewards to CTX stakers and delegators, acknowledging their contribution and trust in our vision.

Last but not least, a mobile app was deployed, enhancing accessibility and ensuring that users can engage with our platform as a mobile experience.

#### Looking Ahead: Q1 of 2024

As we look to the future, the roadmap for Q1 2024 is already charting new territories:

Enhancing our platform's functionality by supporting varied order types for PI, such as limit orders and stop losses.

A new keeper incentives model will be introduced to encourage and reward community participation.

The focus will also be on creating and researching strategies for new and unique oracles, pioneering in the field of data reliability and security.

To maintain growth, we'll develop deployment scripts for Cryptex-owned markets on Perennial V2.

Research will delve into calculating parameters for deploying unique markets on Perennial V2, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of market needs.

And, of course, the DAO will launch new markets, continuing to offer innovative trading options for the community.

As we forge ahead, our mission remains clear: to innovate, empower, and expand. We're excited for this journey. Stay tuned and let's make the coming quarter a landmark period for the community.
