## What are synthetic pegged assets? 

In essence, synthetic pegged assets are tokens that are backed by other assets. These tokens stabilize prices and reduce volatility in the market. They can also provide liquidity to certain markets.

In this blog post, we will discuss synthetic pegged assets in more detail and explore how they work. We will also look at some of the key players in this space, such as [Cryptex Finance,](http://cryptex.finance) [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), and [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) who are all players bringing synthetic pegged assets to Web3. Whilst,  [Y2K Finance](https://www.y2k.finance/) is working to protect the space surrounding these assets.

### **Synthetic Pegged Assets: Introduction**

Synthetic pegged assets are created by tokenizing a real-world asset and then creating derivatives of that token. This allows the synthetic pegged asset to track the price of the underlying asset. 

A derivative is a financial contract whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset. Synthetic pegged assets are created by tokenizing crypto and real-world assets and using derivatives to track its price. By doing this, the synthetic pegged asset can move up or down in price as the underlying asset does.

Tokens created for synthetic pegged assets can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, they can provide liquidity in markets where there is none or make it easier for people to access certain assets without having to pay high fees associated with traditional assets.

### **Examples of Synthetic Pegged Assets**

The most common types of synthetic pegged assets are stablecoins,  index tokens

and commodity-backed tokens. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to maintain a stable value. Index tokens are tokens that tracks the performance of wider markets.

They usually have collateral, such as a reserve of fiat currency or cryptocurrency, which can be used to back up the value of the coin should it fluctuate in price. Here are a few crypto platforms that offer synthetic pegged asset solutions.\

**[Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/): Providing Index Tokens for DeFi**

\
Cryptex Finance allows users to gain exposure to the entire Crypto market-cap or the NFT market-cap, similar to how an ETF is used in the traditional finance world. TCAP gives holders real-time price exposure to the total cryptocurrency market cap, whilst JPEGz will give holders real-time price exposure to the NFT market-cap.\
\
Both of these tokens use Chainlink Price Oracles which allows Cryptex Finance to aggregate multiple data points from the top crypto data providers in the world, resulting in an accurate and real-time representation of market cap.\

#### [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/): Creating a Bridge Between Traditional Markets and DeFi

Synthetix is a protocol that allows users to aquire synthetic pegged assets with ease. The synthetic pegged asset is built on synthetic derivatives and leverages the Synthetix protocol to tokenize real-world assets. This allows users to access traditional markets, such as stocks and bonds, without having to pay high fees associated with traditional investments.

Synthetix also provides an automated market maker (AMM) which makes it easy for users to buy and sell synthetic pegged assets in a decentralized manner. Essentially, it allows users to acquire assets without the need for an intermediary or broker, thus removing any potential liquidity issues associated with traditional markets. On top of this, Synthetix also allows users to use its own stablecoins (sUSD) as collateral to gain access to additional liquidity.

#### [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/en/): Providing Collateralized Debt Positions

Synthetic pegged assets are often backed by collateralized debt positions (CDPs) from Maker DAO, a DeFi protocol on the Ethereum Blockchain that allows users to participate in lending and borrowing. Maker DAO, is also the creator of the stablecoin DAI, which a synthetic pegged asset that is pegged to the US dollar and backed by CDPs.

Maker DAO’s CDPs provide synthetic pegged assets an additional layer of security by allowing users to collateralize their holdings in a decentralized manner. The way this works is that users deposit funds in the CDP, and then they receive DAI tokens in return. These tokens can be used to purchase other synthetic pegged assets and provides a productive base layer infrastructure for the DeFi space.

### Disadvantages of Synthetic Pegged Assets

Despite the benefits of synthetic pegged assets, there are some risks associated with them. One risk is that since these assets are not backed by any physical commodity or currency, are subject to extreme volatility. For example, as a tokenized derivative, if the underlying asset price drops, then there is a chance that the synthetic pegged asset could be worth less than what it was initially purchased for.

Additionally, the underlying technology of these tokens may be complex for indivuals to understand, which exposes them to potential risk. Before taking part in the world of synthetic pegged assets, users should thoroughly do their own research and assure that their asset provider is trustworthy.  

Overall, synthetic pegged assets offer an innovative way for users to access certain assets. As more platforms continue to enter the space, more sophisticated and mature products will be innovating the synthetic pegged asset space.

#### [Y2K Finance:](https://www.y2k.finance/) Leading the Way in Hedge/Risk for Synthetic Pegged Assets

Y2K Finance is on a mission to revolutionize synthetic pegged assets. This is done by using their “Catastophre Bond Insurance” model. Using the Y2K Finance protocol, users are able to hedge and speculate against volatility in stable assets by taking out insurance against the event of a de-pegging.  

#### Final Thoughts

By simulating real-world assets through blockchain technology, synthetic pegged assets are revolutionizing the way that users access markets. Cryptex Finance, Synthetix, and Maker DAO are at the forefront of this revolution. With their efforts, the adoption of synthetic pegged assets will grow in popularity in the future.
