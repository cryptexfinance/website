Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 10th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-01-10-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-8-jan-9th-2022/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

![](/img/daily-chart-1-26-copy.png)

**Analysis:** There was an over $500B dip in the total capitalization (TCAP) of the crypto market. A significant bounce followed on Jan 24th which is represented here by the candle with the significant bottoming tail, referred to as a ‘Hammer’ candle. Hammer candles are regarded as buy signals. Moreover, there is quite a lot of ‘free airspace’ between the market price and the apparent resistance levels. This leads me to the conclusion that the TCAP will most likely bounce back for the next few days. The orange line I’ve drawn on the chart, in my eyes, represents the closest significant resistance level on the daily chart. At around ~$1.8T, this level has been seen as support in the past, and due to the heavy selling/shorting that must occur for a support level to be broken, this level will now act as resistance. Refer to my Intro Post to understand the ‘floor becomes the ceiling and vice versa’ rule. This move will represent a $300B recovery from the last major dip and is a reasonable expectation after a strong move like that. Managing to get past this level will be another bullish indicator and will most likely see TCAP rise further to test the $1.9T - $2T level.

### Daily Indicators

* **MACD:** Curling back up and looking to put in a possible bullish cross, indicating the price will rise from here.
* **RSI:** Pointing sharply upwards, about to exit oversold levels, indicating price will rise.
* **OBV:** Pointing slightly upwards and matches all other indicators in signaling a market bounce.

## Weekly Chart

![](/img/weekly-chart-1-26-copy.png)

**Analysis:** This week’s candle is looking like a very bullish hammer. This is indicative by the significant bottoming tail. The reason this is a bullish signal is because that the market started out the week very bearish and the bulls had enough conviction to bring the price all the way back up to where the week started. That, and the TCAP bouncing twice at the \~$1.5T level indicates that the market has found strong support here. This leads me to believe the market could close out the week in the green, and if it does, the next week will most likely continue upwards. The brown line is the clearest resistance level that I can visually identify on the weekly chart. I’ve left the orange resistance line from the Daily chart to create this sort of ‘resistance range’ and the way we will be able to utilize this, is as each level is broken, we can expect a rise to the next one. If this range is broken, we can safely assume the market will most likely bounce to the next resistance line represented here by the blue line which is the 50-week SMA at just under the \~$2T level, which we can assume from the daily chart’s 20-day SMA is around $1.93T.

### Weekly Indicators

* **MACD:** Still pointing sharply down after bearish cross, indicating price will continue lower.
* **RSI:** A little uptick sideways, could go either way from here.
* **OBV:** Pointing upwards indicating price will increase.

As the indicators are giving mixed signals here, we can’t safely assume the market will have a big bounce. The perfect conditions for such a move aren’t there yet. This means we will have to manage our expectations of the significance of this bounce in the mid-term. The RSI does have room to move lower yet if it’s doing a classic undersold to oversold move. This leads me to believe that the bounce will most likely only be short-term and doesn’t represent the overall end of this downwards move.

## Monthly Chart

**Analysis:** The monthly chart has bounced again near the 20-month SMA. However, if we look at one of the volume sticks, we will see much more selling during the last three months, than we did during the May ‘21 crash as 4 out of the 5 last months’ volume has been dominated by sellers. If the TCAP can bounce from here and break the 3 resistance levels I have drawn, we can expect a full recovery and a new ATH. However, because of the selling volume, I’m currently inclined to believe that the market is more inclined to continue lower overall. It is also important to note that the recovery from May ‘21’s crash has seen weaker buying volume that pre-crash. This leads me to believe that the price could be fragile at this level as it is not accompanied by buyer-conviction. My sentiment remains bearish overall, but this could change with time.

### Monthly Indicators

![](/img/monthly-indicators-1-26-copy.png)

**MACD:** Just put in a bearish cross for the first time since May 2020, which is a huge break in the long-term trend. Indicating price will continue lower.

* **RSI:** Pointing sharply downwards, indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Pointing sharply downwards, indicating price will continue lower.

## Final Thoughts:

We can see by this analysis that things are looking good in the short-term, but in the mid-term, they get confusing, and in the long-term there is a clear downwards trend that seems like it’s at its beginning. I do not believe this crash is over as the timeframe is too quick, and the long-term indicators remain extremely bearish. For these reasons I do expect there to be a bounce to or between the resistance range of ~1.72T - $1.82T range. After that, I do not see TCAP breaking the $2T level again. The market cycles between very overvalued to very undervalued levels and back again. If this is the beginning of a new market cycle, which we might be able to assume due to the several breaks in long-term trends that we did not see in May ‘21, then the market has not continued to the extremely undervalued levels you would expect just yet. It is sitting somewhere in the middle, which the market value usually does not spend much time at.
