**O﻿n January 11th, we hosted our January Community Call. Read below for the most important moments. If you are interested in listening to the full community call, click [here](https://youtu.be/qSsmeGneZ7A) for a full recording.**

**Dev**

“The plan this week is to launch a community testnet, just like in the old days, which will be used to gather feedback in regards to how the front end works, just before launching to the public.

The next step is production testing. This is targeted for the week of the 28th of January, before the launch to the public on the mainnet, to see that everything works as intended. Then we publicly announce that this is open.

Voith finished the governance bridge for Arbitrum which has already been audited. We are really proud of the team for this achievement because we value the security of the users a lot. The Quantstamp team tested everything and let us know everything what all good. This means a lot to us, especially because this is the first formal audit by Voith. This was all on him and we are proud that it was completed and had no issues.

Jorge and Tom have been working on doing an app revamp. There's going to be initial testing which is happening this week, and then we're going to open it to the community. For this, it is key that the community takes part so we can have real feedback from users about how it feels with a new UX/UI design.

Finally, after the JPEGz launch, we are working on sETH as collateral for $TCAP. This has been approved by research. The only reason we haven't implemented it now is that we are focused on $JPEGz, but once we finish, this is like low-hanging fruit that we can reach. We are also exploring using NFTs as collateral, first for $JPEGz and then for $TCAP.” - Cris

**Brand**

“We have an open grant request that is available on Dework. We're really focused on any developers that are interested, and have ideas or specific tasks that can help with integration or building up upon the Cryptex Protocol. We review the requests on a rolling basis, so if you or anybody that is a developer and has some ideas of things that could build on top of the Cryptex Protocol we'd love to hear from you!

On the community side of things, there is a new wiki coming soon. This is part of the app and website revamp that we're having. We wanted a centralized place for people to be able to learn about the protocol, how to use it, and what is available to use.

Switching gears now over to marketing. We published our new educational content for the first time starting last week. We're doing this in two ways. Number one, our SEO article have been written and published. There's been a lot of help from community member hw9 in getting us in a really good place with what to write about and how to execute on it. We have three articles that have been published on the blog already, and we plan to have at least one published a week, every week going forward.

Not only is this good educational content but the content as well is also gonna help us rank from an SEO perspective about things that we are building here at Cryptex and also how that fits into the bigger part of the ecosystem as well.

What we're also doing to get even more reach on this type of content is we are creating Mushroom Man Explains. The first episode of Mushroom Man Explains went live last week on January 3rd. Not only do we publish this on our Twitter account, but Mushroom Man has his own account on TikTok, YouTube, and we're working through Instagram where we could raise more awareness and distribute this incredible video content and educational content that we've created too many more people.

Coming up for the launch of $JPEGz we have some Twitter spaces that are scheduled. On January 27th, we'll be a guest on Arbitrum's Twitter space, on January 30th we will be a guest on Rug Radio, and then on January 31st with Wolf and Ramp Capital we also have a Twitter space scheduled.

And then last but not least, events are a big focus for us to connect with developers and users. We are going to be participating in and creating a side event at ETHDenver with some of our partners. We had a wonderful event last year, there were a couple of hundred people that attended this year we're excited to go a little bit bigger by bringing in some more partners there and kind of setting up a place where we can speak and talk about what we're building and why we're excited about the future. There'll be a few other events like NFT LA and NFT NYC where we are looking to get some of our contributors to be speaking at and participate in as well but more info to follow for those events when we are there.” - Matz

“It should be known that we're doing everything that the DAO can do to get $JPEGz released at the end of the month. We've been very transparent about our partnerships with Arbitrum, in how we're launching this, and the work that we've all done together in bringing JPEGz to life. We're excited to see what happens upon launch. We think that JPEGz represents a very unique opportunity in terms of getting these NFT collections aggregated in an index and allowing users to be able to track them.

Two of the things that we're still working on with regard to this are the liquidity incentives around JPEGz and obviously the burn mechanism around it. That is something that goes entirely to the DAO and then gets voted on in terms of how it's utilized once it's there.

We're doing everything that we can do to make the end of this month as successful as possible from when we release JPEGz into the world. In terms of partnerships, biz, and marketing, I'd expect there to be a lot of activity. All we can do is kind of see how that transpires into the usage of JPEGz, but we think that with the partnerships and the people that we're working with on this, we have a very good shot” - Joe
