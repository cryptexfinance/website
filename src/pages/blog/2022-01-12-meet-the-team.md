**Weekly, Cryptex Finance will interview one of the core team members involved in building the world's first Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP). This week, Cullen shares his background and his design role with Cryptex.**

**"What did you do before Cryptex?"**

I’m a visual effects artist, animator, and director. I’ve worked on shows like room 104, strange angel, and Man in the High Castle. Those are kind of some of the bigger ones I've worked on.

**"What is your role at Cryptex?"**

I’m a digital content creator, make all the video and art for the announcement videos.

**"When did you first get into crypto?"**

Cryptex is my first crypto venture. But, a friend of mine years ago invested in something on Coinbase and doubled his holdings. That was around the time I got introduced to crypto. He turned something like six grand into like 60 or something or at its peak. I was like, wow. After that was pretty much when I found Cryptex.

**“What’s your favorite piece of Cryptex content you’ve made?”**

I really dig the visuals and feel of the Gemini announcement video. I was doing fluid simulations. I just liked how it ended up, it kind of reminded me of the blood from the predator. How it glows and stuff.

**"What's a fun fact that people don't know about you?"**

I ballroom dance, and I’m a scuba diver.

**"What's the best Cryptex meme you've seen?"**
