Weekly, Cryptex will interview one of the core team members involved in building the world's first Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP). This week, Prysmatic Labs co-founder Preston Van Loon shares his background and his role in development at Cryptex. His time leading blockchain developers at Prysmatic and receiving a $2M grant from the Ethereum Foundation gives him valuable insight into how to make Cryptex a world-class project.

**"What did you do before Cryptex?"**

I was working at Google in New York City when we started thinking about Cryptex and I was also, and still am working at Prysmatic Labs to develop Ethereum's core protocol, infrastructure, and major upgrades to the Ethereum protocol system.

**"When did you first get into crypto?"**

I would say I first got into crypto in 2017, right around the big ICO hype with Ethereum. I had heard about Bitcoin previously but wasn't that interested in it until I found Ethereum, when I saw there are a very wide array of use cases. I thought that the potential is extremely intriguing and I kind of got hooked into understanding how it works. I wanted to get involved because obviously there are still a lot of things to fix with Ethereum, it's a high-potential project but has a lot of work to do. I started digging into the protocol ways to get involved, and that led me to meet Raul Jordan, and we formed a team called Prysmatic Labs. We've been building into Ethereum's core protocol since 2018.

**"What is your role at Cryptex?"**

I am the blockchain lead at Cryptex. I was a big part of developing the architecture and system for TCAP. I helped write the white paper and I continue to work on new innovations and ideas on how to make TCAP better and how to further the mission of Cryptex.

**"What has been your experience building Ethereum but also building on Ethereum?"**

My experience building Ethereum's core protocol has been that we have just an amazing developer community. I went from a casual interest to a complete obsession in a short amount of time. When I said to the community, "I want to get involved" it was with open arms, everyone was very inviting and friendly, and smart. There are these really crazy, interesting problems in computer science to solve with the theory of blockchain that haven't quite been solved in this way before. It's been a very challenging and interesting journey so far.

Part of that learning and experience with building on the protocol, or building into the protocol is understanding what people are building on top of Ethereum. So that brings me to interest with the application layer. That's kind of a natural progression from protocol to app development with Cryptex. I tried to stay close to what our users are doing. So thinking about Ethereum as a protocol, who are the users that typically are first to adapt developers and understand what they're doing in the DeFi space. Building with Cryptex has given me a great perspective on how users are using it, what people want out of it, and what some of the problems are. That helps drive decisions and thinking about what to prioritize with core protocol development.
