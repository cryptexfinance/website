Cryptex Finance is a DeFi protocol on the Arbitrum network that builds cutting edge markets within a new system called Cryptex Pi.

Cryptex Pi uses Ethereum smart contracts, Perennial derivatives vaults, and Pyth data oracles to provide secure and decentralized trading for users.

Cryptex has partnered with Pyth to provide the low latency oracles needed to create these cutting edge financial solutions. <https://pyth.network/>

Some benefits of Pyth oracles are as follows:

* Latency and frequency of updates.
* Security measures (<https://pyth.network/blog/reliability-efforts-at-pyth>) (such as confidence intervals (<https://pyth.network/blog/what-is-confidence>))
* Ease of integration.
* Competitive platform fees thanks to Pull Oracle design ([https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-a-new-model-to-the-price-oracle](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-a-new-model-to-the-price-oracle "https\://pyth.network/blog/pyth-a-new-model-to-the-price-oracle")).
* Wide coverage of assets.
* Presence across multiple blockchains.

Currently, Pyth oracles power 12 markets within the Cryptex protocol via our integration with Perennial Labs, offering users low latency, low fees and the reliable access these markets at any time.

The Cryptex DAO plans to both develop and integrate many more customizable markets for the Cryptex Pi system.

As part of this partnership, Cryptex is thrilled to announce the DAO is the recipient of PYTH tokens.

These tokens are part of Pythâ€™s Retrospective Airdrop program, and can be utilized for anything in line with the core mission of continued growth and development of the Cryptex DAO, to which Cryptex protocol delegates and community members have 100% discretion via snapshot and voting with CTX governance.

We extend a sincere thank you to Pyth, not only for this retroactive airdrop but for their partnership and commitment to providing the oracles required to develop state of the art decentralized solutions.
