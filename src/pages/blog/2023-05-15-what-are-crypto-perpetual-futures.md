Crypto perpetual futures have become a popular trading instrument in the cryptocurrency market. They are a type of futures contract that doesn't expire, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. Perpetual futures contracts have gained widespread popularity because they enable traders to take advantage of the price movements in cryptocurrencies without the need to own the underlying asset. In this article, we will explain what crypto perpetual futures are and provide examples of different exchanges that offer them.



## What are Crypto Perpetual Futures?



A perpetual future is a contract that has no expiration date. This means that traders can hold their positions for as long as they want. In contrast, traditional futures contracts have a set expiration date, after which the contract must be settled.



In perpetual futures trading, the settlement of the contract is usually done every 8 hours. This is known as the funding rate. The funding rate is a mechanism designed to keep the price of the perpetual futures contract in line with the price of the underlying asset. If the price of the contract is above the price of the underlying asset, long position holders will pay a fee to short position holders. If the price of the contract is below the price of the underlying asset, short position holders will pay a fee to long position holders.



Crypto perpetual futures are typically used by traders who want to trade the price movements of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. Traders can open long or short positions, depending on whether they think the price of the cryptocurrency will go up or down.
