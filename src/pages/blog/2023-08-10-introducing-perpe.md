##### **Additional Parameters**:

##### **1. PERPE Maintenance: 5%**

With this value, we calculate the maximum leverage = 1/0.05 = 20

##### **2. PERPE Funding Fee: 0%**

This is the percentage of the Funding Fee that can be claimed by the protocol.
**This is currently set to 0 so that Makers can claim the entire funding amount.**

##### **3. PERPE Maker Fee: 0%**

This is the fee charged as a percentage of the Maker notional amount.
**This is currently set to 0 to incentivize Makers while bootstrapping this market.**

##### **4. PERPE Taker Fee: 0.15%**
This is the fee charged as a percentage of the Taker notional amount and is currently paid entirely to the Makers.

##### **5. PERPE Position Fee: 0%**
This is the percentage of the Maker/Taker fees that can be kept by the protocol. A value of 1 indicates that all the fees will be distributed to the protocol and 0 if all the fees are to be distributed to Makers/Takers. **It is currently set to 0, distributing all Taker fees to Makers during the bootstrapping period.**

##### **6. PERPE Maker Limit: 60 Trillion PEPE**
This is the maximum amount of Maker notional amount that a market can have. This value is approximately 3 million USD in collateral.
